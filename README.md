Crafted a killer SQL query to validate student responses for an Olympiad exam
# Olympiad Exam Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains SQL code for analyzing the results of an Olympiad exam conducted for partner schools. The project involves processing data from four tables - `student_list`, `student_response`, `correct_answers`, and `question_paper_code` - to validate student responses and present insightful metrics.

## SQL Solution

I've implemented a robust SQL query to consolidate data and generate a comprehensive output table. The table includes key metrics such as `roll_number`, `student_name`, `class`, `section`, `school_name`, `math_correct`, `math_wrong`, `math_yet_to_learn`, `math_score`, `math_percentage`, `Science_correct`, `Science_wrong`, `Science_yet_to_learn`, `Science_score`, `Science_percentage`.
